<h2 align= "center">Data Scientist | Mechanical Engineer</h2>

<h2 align = left>About Me:</h2>
Hi there! I'm a Mechanical Engineer who embarked on a journey into the world of data science and coding. Alongside my engineering background, I recently completed a Data Science course at Le Wagon, where I honed my skills in programming and data analysis. My passion for coding began at an early stage, driven purely by my own curiosity and interest. As I delved deeper into the realm of technology, I discovered a unique way to combine my technical knowledge with my love for the arts. I started creating technical support specifically for artists, assisting them in achiving their creative ideas. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to further expand my expertise in both engineering and coding, and I'm excited to see where this ever-evolving journey takes me next.
